**cv.html** is a minimalist CV/résumé template to export as a one-page A4 PDF.

## Notes

* This template has not been tested with any automated screening software.
* There are [better templates](https://github.com/jakegut/resume) if you prefer LaTeX.

## Usage

1. Add your details to `cv.html`. Structure it in a way that fits your profile.
2. Optionally, you can adjust the design in `cv.css`. Some basics are defined as custom properties.
3. Open `cv.html` in a (preferably Chromium-based) browser and check if everything looks fine and all content is contained within the inner red box.
4. Use your browser's built-in print functionality to save the website as a PDF document.
